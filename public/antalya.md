If you are in Antalya, you must experience the cable car - *Olympos Teleferik*. This photo was taken on top of Mount Tahtali. Could be the upcoming ads for Nike.

Spotted this beauty while being lost on the way to Olympos.

Our favorite restaurant in Antalya has to be *Il Vicino Pizzeria*.

Go 30km northwest of Antalya and you will end up in the ancient site of *Termessos*, a city with such dramatic setting that Alexander the Great failed to take. It can keep you away from the usual tourist crowds. Make sure you have your hiking boots ready!
