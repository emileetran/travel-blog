Me at the *Swayambhunath*, or the Monkey Temple, one of the oldest and most holy Buddhist sites in Nepal. Sadly, it was also heavily damaged by the earthquake.

*The Garden of Dreams*, also known as the Garden of Six Season, as its name suggests, is the perfect place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu.
